# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for
receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.1 Rating:

| CVSS v3.1 | Supported Versions |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x       | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x       | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[security@jpprofessionals.de](mailto:info@jpprofessionals.de)**. You will receive a response from
us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
